-- 199: Mute cosmetic "game_updated" notifications — only notify on a reschedule.
--
-- Problem: `trg_games_notify`'s UPDATE branch fires a "game_updated" push to the
-- WHOLE roster on any UPDATE that isn't a completion/cancellation. sv-sync (and
-- bp-sync) rewrite a `games` row whenever ANY of its COMPARE_FIELDS drift —
-- including `referees_json`, `sets_json`, `league`, `round`, in-progress scores.
-- The SV feed shuffles referee assignments / partial set data between syncs, so
-- the same fixture ("H3 vs Voléro on 02.10.26") re-notifies every few hours even
-- though nothing a player cares about changed.
--
-- Fix: in the `game_updated` (ELSE) branch, bail out with RETURN NEW unless the
-- game's date OR time actually changed. Cancellation is unaffected — it takes the
-- separate `status -> cancelled` branch which fires "game_deleted" and is NOT
-- gated here, so "cancelled" still notifies. Completion ("game_result") and
-- creation ("game_created") are likewise untouched.
--
-- The mute is at the trigger, so it covers every writer of `games` (sv-sync,
-- bp-sync, manual scheduling reschedules) uniformly, not just one sync path.
-- A pure venue/hall change with no date/time change is intentionally muted too,
-- per the request (datetime change and/or cancelled only).
--
-- Idempotent: CREATE OR REPLACE. Body is byte-identical to the live definition
-- (SCHEMA.sql / migration 095) except the added gate in the ELSE branch.
